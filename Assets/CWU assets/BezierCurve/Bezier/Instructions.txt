Drag script onto an object


quadratic
Curve starts at P0 and curves toward P1 on the way to P2, creating a parabolic curve
(curve usually does not pass through P1)	// see wikipedia for a graph of the curve


cubic
Curve starts at P0 and curves toward P1, then curves out of an arc near P2 on the way to P3
(curve usually does not pass through P1 or P2)	// see wikipedia for a graph of the curve


/*
 * the "Total Subdivisions" is calculated from "Subdivisions Per Section" and is only for display
 * when the curve is created, the subdivisions per section is forced to 1-100 inclusive
 * (the 1-100 limit is mainly to prevent lag from dragging the value to an extreme number in the editor)
 */
if( the curve is not smooth enough )
	increase the "Subdivisions Per Section";


/* 
 * the line renderer box will create a new line renderer, or use one already attached to the object
 * unchecking will not remove an existing line renderer (in case it has a setup the user wants to save)
 */
if( you want a LineRenderer to draw the bezier curve in-game )
	check the "Use Line Renderer" box;


/*
 * transform positions and rotations will be used
 * the values are global and will be effected by parent transforms as well
 */
if( you want the bezier to stay with the transform )
	check the "Stay With Transform" box;


/*
 * transform scale will be used
 * the values are global and will be effected by parent transforms as well
 */
if( you want the bezier to use the transform scale )
	check the "Use Transform Scale" box;


/*
 * changing the bezier curve via script functions will cause the curve to update once,
 * instead of every frame (unless the curve is changed via script every frame)
 */
if( you want the bezier to keep updating because of manual changes )
	check the "Continual Recalculate" box;
